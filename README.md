# Digital-Library
prerequisite : HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Digital Library-  A project which will make you go through  one of the most popular web development stack- (MEAN Stack). In course of doing this project you will not only learn a new stack but also explore its real life use cases. Its my utmost belief that this will advance you for creating higher level project design. This will give you a head start and advantage over others for cracking top IT MNC interviews. I would expect you to explore more for developing a digital library and not restricted to the sample project.

Step to Start this project

Install Node JS

install Angular using NPM

Set up a mongo DB

Go to server/config/conf.json and set the path for development environment
PORT

Go to a preferable browser and your project will be running on 
localhost:4200/e-library/home
